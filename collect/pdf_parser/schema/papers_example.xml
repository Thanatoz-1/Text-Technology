                <title>onversion of Airborne to Bone-Conducted Speech with Deep Neural Networks</title>
                <abstract>
                    It is a common experience of most speakers that the playback of one’s
own voice sounds strange. This can be mainly attributed to the missing
bone-conducted speech signal that is not present in the playback signal.
It was also shown that some phonemes have a high bone-conducted relative
to air-conducted sound transmission, which means that the bone-conduction
filter is phone-dependent. To achieve such a phone-dependent modeling
we train different speaker dependent and speaker adaptive speech conversion
systems using airborne and bone-conducted speech data from 8 speakers
(5 male, 3 female), which allow for the conversion of airborne speech
to bone-conducted speech. The systems are based on Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) deep neural networks, where the speaker adaptive versions
with speaker embedding can be used without bone-conduction signals
from the target speaker. Additionally we also used models that apply
a global filtering. The different models are then evaluated by an objective
error metric and a subjective listening experiment, which show that
the LSTM based models outperform the global filters.

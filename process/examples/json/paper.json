This allows the system to accurately balance between the articulation strength of the visual articulators and the signal smoothness of the visual mode in order to optimize the synthesis. To improve the synthesis quality, an automatic database normalization strategy has been designed that removes variations from the database which are not related to speech production.

VT midpoints are determined by progressively fitting circles along the VT-length from the glottis to lip opening. The VT-length is obtained by summing up the distance between adjacent midpoints. Lip-tube length is defined as the distance between the incisors and the lip opening along the midline. Results show that the range of VT-length variation is 3.2cm with the average VTlength of 16.4cm. The cause of this large range appears to be the combination of the vowel dependent VT-length and prosodic position that influences on the glottal height. For example, during a vowel at sentence final position, glottis goes down with falling intonation or up with rising intonation corresponding to, respectively, VT lengthening or shortening. The lip-tube lengths are little affected by prosodic position and exhibit a clear vowel dependency. The prosodic influences manifested on the glottal height are not compensated but rather expanded in the VT-length, yet maintaining the characteristic vowel-dependency.

However, it is not merely the case that the consonantal gesture of /l/ is completely lost in these syllable positions, leaving behind a simple vocalic configuration.

The result is a lowered tongue blade relative to the tongue tip and dorsum. This shaping is captured through measures of Gaussian curvature at evenly spaced points along the tongue.

With the original senone classification task as the primary task, and adding auxiliary mono-phone/senone-cluster classification as the secondary tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) is employed to adapt the DNN parameters. With the proposed MTL adaptation framework, we improve the learning ability of the original DNN structure, then enlarge the coverage of the acoustic space to deal with the unseen senone problem, and thus enhance the discrimination power of the adapted DNN models.

Contrary to most widely used techniques based on active contours, the proposed method aims at exploiting the information of all image pixels to infer the tongue contour.

In this paper, we examined methods to automatically estimate\nspots where the lecturer explains on the slide using lecture speech\nand slide data.

For itemized text slides, using DTW with word embedding\nbased distance, we obtained higher estimation accuracy than a previous\nwork.

Exploiting out-of-domain data while retaining the relevant in-domain statistics is a desired property in these scenarios. Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) regularization is a popular method for acoustic model (AM) adaptation. KLD regularization assumes that the last layer is a softmax that fully activates the targets of both in-domain and out-of-domain models. Unfortunately, this softmax activation is computationally prohibitive for language modeling where the number of output classes is large, typically 50k to 100K, but may even exceed 800k in some cases. The computational bottleneck of the softmax during LM training can be reduced by an order of magnitude using techniques such as noise contrastive estimation (NCE), which replaces the cross-entropy loss function with a binary classification problem between the target output and random noise samples. In this work we combine NCE and KLD regularization and offer a fast domain adaptation method for LM training, while also retaining important attributes of the original NCE, such as self-normalization.
